# Arduino Sketchbook
A repository to store completed and work in progress sketches. Sketches will generally be written in VS Code with PlatformIO and organized into individual project folders. For simple sketches, main.cpp can be used within the Arduino IDE. Change the extension to ino and comment out or remove the first include statement. For more complex sketches, check the Arduino IDE folder for ino files and associated libraries.
